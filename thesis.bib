The problem of collisions is crucial. A robust reactive algorithm, named the "skeleton algorithm", is proposed for the real-time generation of self-collision avoidance motions, where only proprioceptive sensory data are needed. The algorithm is applied to the DLR humanoid manipulator Justin, and a joint-torque control is used, where the collision avoidance torques are summed to the desired torques corresponding to other tasks; experimental results are reported.},  keywords={collision avoidance;humanoid robots;manipulator kinematics;sensors;torque control;skeleton algorithm;self-collision avoidance;unstructured domain;multiarm robotic system;reactive control scheme;proprioceptive sensory data;joint-torque control;Justin DLR humanoid manipulator;Skeleton;Manipulators;Robot sensing systems;Humanoid robots;Collision avoidance;Kinematics;Motion control;Control systems;Robotics and automation;Arm;Index Terms;Self-collision avoidance;Reactive control;Humanoid robots;Kinematics},  doi={10.1109/AIM.2007.4412606},  ISSN={2159-6255},  month={Sep.},}
